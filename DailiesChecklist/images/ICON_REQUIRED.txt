ICON REQUIRED FOR DALAMUD PLUGIN REPOSITORY SUBMISSION
======================================================

Before submitting this plugin to the Dalamud plugin repository, you must add an icon.png file to this directory.

Requirements:
- File name: icon.png
- Size: Between 64x64 and 512x512 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Location: This directory (DailiesChecklist/images/)

The icon will be displayed in the Dalamud plugin installer and should visually represent the plugin's functionality.

Recommended:
- Use a square aspect ratio (e.g., 128x128, 256x256, or 512x512)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using colors that stand out in the plugin list

Once you add icon.png to this directory, you can delete this file.
